Ace v2.1
---

Thanks for using Ace admin template.  

Basic files inside `node_modules` folder are included to view the demo.  
However for full functionality and to customize CSS and JS files, you should run `npm install` to install required libraries and frameworks.  

You may also need to install `git` if see an error like this:  
```
npm ERR! code ENOENT
npm ERR! syscall spawn git
```


Then open `index.html` or run `node index.js`.  

To view documentation open `documentation.html`.  

Let me know if you have any questions.
